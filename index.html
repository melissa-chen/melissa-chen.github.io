      <h2 class="h-about">brief overview</h2>
      I was born 20 years ago in College Station, Texas. I grew up in San Bernardino, CA before moving to Rancho Cucamonga, CA for high school. I go back to Rancho during breaks. For now, I live in an apartment with three other girls in Los Angeles, CA while I attend UCLA!
      <h2 class="h-about">ucla</h2>
      I currently study Computer Science at UCLA. I walk about two miles every day just to go to my classes. Yup.. but don't get me wrong, I love my uni experience (and the walking is good for hatching my Pokemon Go eggs)! I've grown so much since I came here and I've met some of the coolest people in my life. I've been inspired by my super smart and talented friends, TA's, and even strangers!!
      <h2 class="h-about">hobbies</h2>
      Since I was young, I've really enjoyed the arts. In my free time, I like to draw both traditionally and digitally. I also enjoy acting in theatre productions at school and singing awfully.

    <div class="content" id="resume">
      <h1 class="h-resume">resume</h1>
        I am looking for full-time opportunities in software engineering and/or front-end/full stack engineering, able to start in Fall 2018. I'm currently exploring various fields of computer science and am open to trying many things, but one thing I know I would like to explore is UI/UX design.
